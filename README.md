# jQuery Lite

This project was made to learn the various functions of Vanilla JavaScript by building a lite version of jQuery.

This project uses `$l` as the jQuery function rather than `$`. Test out the following functions in your own browser:

- [x] `$l(selector)`
- [x] `$l(HTMLElement)`
- [ ] `$l(Function)`
- [x] `.html`
- [x] `.empty`
- [x] `.append`
- [x] `.attr`
- [x] `.addClass`
- [x] `.remove`
- [x] `.children`
- [x] `.parent`
- [x] `.find`
- [x] `.remove`
- [x] `.on`
- [x] `.off`
